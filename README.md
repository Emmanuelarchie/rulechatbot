Clinic Rule-Based Chatbot

This project is a rule-based chatbot system designed for a clinic to automate patient interactions. The chatbot provides predefined responses based on keyword matching and decision-tree logic to assist patients with common inquiries.

It is lightweight, fast, and does not rely on external AI APIs or machine learning models.
